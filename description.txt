1. General rules 

- Code of the project should be hosted on github, you should have more than 10 commits to review creation process

- No BE is required, it would be great plus if you can use JS server implementations + DB (eg. Node.js + mongo)

- All data should be stored in browser 'local storage' (optional, but would be nice)

- Usage of any frameworks is allowed, except ticker implementation (will be described below).

- Using backbone would be a plus

2. Task

Create 1-page application. It will consist of 3 views. First view represents defauls sorting of tickers, 2nd - ascending, 3rd - descending.

On the left side of page 2 promotional items located. 1 Just an image with some text, learn more should not lead anywhere. Second - image slider with some images of your choice.

Main goal is to create high performance digit tickers. They should start from different amount and tick up to infinite with different speed. Ticking step should always be the same - 0.01.
Please look at example here - http://www.vernons.com/games/jackpots

You should be able to 100+ tickers with no significant performance loss.

Add new brings up the prompt to add new ticker. Consists of 2 fields - title and starting amount. Data should be saved to local storage.

Ascending and Descending view should sort tickers in correct order.

Search field should be functional and search by title, without submitting. Basically not relevant issues should be removed while you type.

Ticker items can be deleted by clicking on them.

3. Execution

Goal of the task to create high performance tickers, please concentrate on creating those, than proceed to remaining functionality.

4. Timing

Results should be presented not later than 27.05.13
